## Differences

Almost the same as the official version. Only minor changes have been made to the [webpack.config.js](packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js).

These changes allow to

- Import `./src/scss/index.scss` globally
- Edit the webpack target to `electron-renderer`

Example:

- [Pong420/create-react-app-ts-starter](https://github.com/Pong420/create-react-app-ts-starter)
- [Pong420/electron-with-cra-ts](https://github.com/Pong420/electron-with-cra-ts)
